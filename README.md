# An-Ai-System-of-Dog-Breed-Classification-Using-Imagenet
## Overview

This project involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify different dog breeds. The dataset consists of images of various dog breeds, which are split into training and validation sets. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set.
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (if using Google Drive for dataset storage)
  
## Dataset
This dataset is available on Kaggle. You can access it using the following link:
[Dog Breed Classification dataset of 120 dog breeds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikaschauhan734/120-dog-breed-image-classification)

## Add Efficiency
- Due to the shortage of resourse this model is trained for 15 Epochs you can increse it epoch to make the model much more efficent.
- Must have an eye on the model perfformance to not to overfit it.
